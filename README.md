### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Arrays: Variable groups that hold more than one assigned values like a list of items. Useful for item indexes on webpages.
2. Functions/Loops: Executable codes line that activate when called upon. Loops on the otherhand, are lines of executable code that run and end after certain requirements of the assigned task are met.
